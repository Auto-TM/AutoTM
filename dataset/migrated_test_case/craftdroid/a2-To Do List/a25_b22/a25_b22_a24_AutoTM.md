### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click to activate the input app bar. After clicking, no new page appears and no new widgets are added. The current page remains active with editable text field for the new list name and an 'Add' button to create a new list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), long click, NULL): Long press to activate additional options for the 'Simply Do' title. No new page is navigated to, and no new widgets appear as a result of this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, "New List Name"): Click to edit the new list name on the existing list name field. No new elements or page appears after this interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), long_click, "New List Name"): Long click to edit the list name. No new page appears after the long click, but the list name field is highlighted for editing.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click to add a new list. The interaction with this control does not navigate to a new page, but presumably processes the input from the EditText field labeled "New List Name".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), longClick, "Add"): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes to the current page.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the source test case, the first step is to click on the 'Add' button to create a new item in the shopping list. Comparing this to the current page's intentions, the functionally closest operation would be clicking the 'Add' button to create a new list. However, these operations are not exactly the same, as one is adding an item to a list and the other is creating a new list. 

Given the disparity in operations, the best course of action would be to perform the operation on the target app that closely resembles the function of the 'Add' button in the source app. In this case, it would be clicking on the EditText field labeled "New List Name" to enter a new list name, and then clicking 'Add' to create the new list.

Here is your next migration step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, NULL): Click to activate the input for new list name.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), input, "Sample Todo"): Input the description 'Sample Todo' for the new list.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click on the 'Add' button to create the new list with name 'Sample Todo'.
~~~
Based on the provided actions, we can convert them into UIAutomator2 code as follows:

```python
d.click(0, 49)
d(resourceId="kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText").set_text("Sample Todo")
d.click(273, 49)
```
In the above code, we are first clicking on the EditText field to activate it for input. Then, we are setting the text of the EditText field to 'Sample Todo'. Finally, we are clicking on the 'Add' button to create a new list with the name 'Sample Todo'.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click on "Simply Do" title. This action does not navigate to a new page, but refreshes the current page emphasizing on the same title "Simply Do". No new widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), longClicked, "Simply Do"): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the same page reloads again, possibly with app data updated in the background.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, "New List Name"): Click to input a name for the new list. After clicking this widget, new widget 'Add' button appears which can be used to add this list.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), longClick, "New List Name"): Long press to prompt copy-paste suggestions or auto-correction for input name. Interacting with this control does not navigate to a new page, but updates the same page with either new suggestive inputs or auto-corrected name for the new list to be created.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Clicking this control adds a new list to the ListView. A new 'Sample Todo' list item appears in the ListView after the click operation.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), long click, "Add"): Long-press to add a new list. Long-pressing on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the list gets extended with the addition of a new task list item.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), click, NULL): 
Click to view the list. Interacting with this control does not navigate to a new page, but expands the list view, showing additional list items (android.widget.LinearLayout) of 'Sample Todo'.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), longClick, NULL): LongClick to view list options. The new dialog appears with options 'Edit' and 'Delete'.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), click, "Sample Todo"): The click navigates to the/todo list 'Sample Todo'. The next page allows the user to add items to this list with 'New Item Name' textbox field and 'Add' button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), longClick, "Sample Todo"): Long clicking on this widget opens the "List Options" dialog with options to "Edit" and "Delete".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), click, "(0/0)"): Click to open 'Sample Todo' list. The page after clicking this control is the 'Sample Todo' list page, which has a 'New Item Name' input field and an 'Add' button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), longClick, "(0/0)"): Long click to bring up the List Options menu, which includes options to Edit or Delete the list.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the source test case semantics, the action sequence that has been successfully executed in the target app, and the current page's intentions, the next step would be to verify the successful creation of the 'Sample Todo' list. This corresponds to the fourth step in the source test case. This can be done by checking the presence of 'Sample Todo' in the ListView.

Here's the next step to take:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify the presence of 'Sample Todo' in the ListView indicating that the list has been added successfully.
~~~
Based on the provided information, we need to convert an ASSERT action into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Since the action involves verifying the presence of text, we will use the `assert` statement and check for the presence of the text "Sample Todo" in the `TextView` with the specified ID. We will not use the coordinates because the action requires checking for text presence, which is more reliably done using the text attribute if the ID is unique.

Here is the corresponding UIAutomator2 code:

```python
assert d(resourceId="kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1").get_text() == "Sample Todo"
```

This code asserts that the `TextView` with the resource ID `kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1` contains the text "Sample Todo". If the text is not present, the assertion will fail, indicating that the list has not been added successfully.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click on "Simply Do" title. This action does not navigate to a new page, but refreshes the current page emphasizing on the same title "Simply Do". No new widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), longClicked, "Simply Do"): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the same page reloads again, possibly with app data updated in the background.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, "New List Name"): Click to input a name for the new list. After clicking this widget, new widget 'Add' button appears which can be used to add this list.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), longClick, "New List Name"): Long press to prompt copy-paste suggestions or auto-correction for input name. Interacting with this control does not navigate to a new page, but updates the same page with either new suggestive inputs or auto-corrected name for the new list to be created.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Clicking this control adds a new list to the ListView. A new 'Sample Todo' list item appears in the ListView after the click operation.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), long click, "Add"): Long-press to add a new list. Long-pressing on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the list gets extended with the addition of a new task list item.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), click, NULL): 
Click to view the list. Interacting with this control does not navigate to a new page, but expands the list view, showing additional list items (android.widget.LinearLayout) of 'Sample Todo'.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), longClick, NULL): LongClick to view list options. The new dialog appears with options 'Edit' and 'Delete'.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), click, "Sample Todo"): The click navigates to the/todo list 'Sample Todo'. The next page allows the user to add items to this list with 'New Item Name' textbox field and 'Add' button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), longClick, "Sample Todo"): Long clicking on this widget opens the "List Options" dialog with options to "Edit" and "Delete".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), click, "(0/0)"): Click to open 'Sample Todo' list. The page after clicking this control is the 'Sample Todo' list page, which has a 'New Item Name' input field and an 'Add' button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), longClick, "(0/0)"): Long click to bring up the List Options menu, which includes options to Edit or Delete the list.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given the source test case semantics, the current page's intentions, and the sequence of executed actions, we have successfully completed the first three steps and one assertion from the source test case. 

The next step in the source test case is to perform a swipe right operation on the list item 'Sample Todo' to delete it. However, in the target application, the deletion operation is performed differently. It requires a long click operation on the List item to bring up the List Options menu and then click on the Delete option. 

So based on the available intentions and the source test case, the next action to perform is the long click operation on the 'Sample Todo' list to bring up List Options:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), longClick, "Sample Todo"): Long click to open the 'List Options' dialog.
~~~
Based on your description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

```python
d(text="Sample Todo").long_click(1)
```
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (25, 247), click, "NULL"): Click to open the list options dialog. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but displays a pop-up menu/dialog which includes Edit and Delete options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (25, 247), long click, "List Options"): Long click to open the list options dialog. The list options dialog presents options to either edit or delete a list. Performing a long click on this control does not navigate to a new page, but instead, a dialog with "Edit" and "Delete" options appears.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/select_dialog_listview, (15, 293), click, NULL): Click to show list options. After clicking on this control, the same "List Options" page remains open, providing options for "Edit" and "Delete".
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/select_dialog_listview, (15, 293), longClick, NULL): Long press to view list options. Long press on this control does not navigate to a new page, but presents the 'List Options' dialog which includes 'Edit' and 'Delete' options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (25, 310), click, "Edit"): The purpose of this action is to navigate to the "Edit List Label" page, which provides an interface to edit the name of the selected to-do list. After clicking this control, a new page appears with edit text field pre-populated with the current to-do list name and options "OK" and "Cancel" for confirming or discarding the changes respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (25, 310), longClick, "Edit"): Long click on 'Edit' to modify a selected todo list. This opens a dialog to edit the list label with 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons available.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (25, 375), click, "Delete"): Click to show the deletion confirmation dialog. After clicking, the new page will ask the user "Are you sure you want to delete this list?", providing "Yes" and "No" options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (25, 310), long click, "Edit"): Long clicking this option opens a dialog for editing the list item. The new dialog/page has buttons for confirming the 'Delete' action, asking 'Are you sure you want to delete this list?'.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed actions, the current page's intentions, and the source test case, it seems like the migration process has successfully completed steps 1 to 4 of the source test case. The input and addition of the 'Sample Todo' item in the list have been achieved so far.

The next step, based on the source test case, is to delete the 'Sample Todo' item. However, the only related action in the current page's intentions that seems similar is clicking on the 'Delete' option. The next step would then be to initiate the 'Delete' option for the 'Sample Todo' item.

Here's the next step for your test migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (25, 375), click, "Delete"): Initiate deletion of 'Sample Todo' item from the list.
~~~
Based on the given input, we need to convert the action of initiating the deletion of a 'Sample Todo' item from the list into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Since the coordinates are provided and precise, we will use them for the action. Here's the corresponding output:

```python
d.click(25, 375)
```
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (25, 246), click, "List Options"): Clicking 'List Options' does not navigate to a new page, but the current page now includes options 'Yes' and 'No' for confirming the deletion of a list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (25, 246), long click, "Delete?"): Long click to trigger contextual options related to the list item. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog/popupMenu which includes "Yes" and "No" options appears, prompting the user to confirm or cancel the deletion of the list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (29, 294), click, "Are you sure you want to delete this list?"): Click to confirm the deletion action. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a confirmation dialog appears, which includes Yes and No options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (29, 294), longClick, "Are you sure you want to delete this list?"): Holding this message does not navigate to a new page, but it might trigger another UI event or function in the application. The change between the current page and next page JSON is not apparent in the given data.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (17, 374), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm the deletion of the list. After clicking this control, the app navigates to the main page where user's lists of to-dos are displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (17, 374), longClick, "Yes"): Long clicking deletes a list. After the action, navigates to the main homepage which has a button to add a new list and a list view of your existing lists.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (161, 374), click, "No"): Click to cancel the delete operation and return to the task list. The page after clicking shows the updated task list without the deleted item.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (161, 374), long click, "No"): Long click to cancel the deletion process. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the list view is restored to its previous state with options to add new lists or manage existing ones.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it's evident that the performed actions correspond to the first three actions of the source test case and part of the fifth action. The creation of a new item named 'Sample Todo', its description, and the confirmation of the addition are successful. The deletion process of 'Sample Todo' has been initiated as well.

Considering the current page's intentions, the next step should confirm the deletion. The action 'clicking on 'Yes'' serves this purpose. So, the next action for migration would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (17, 374), click, 'Yes'): Confirm the deletion of the item 'Sample Todo' from the list.
~~~
Based on the provided actions, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

···
d.click(17, 374)
···

In this case, the coordinates are precise and unique, so we use the coordinates to perform the click action. The 'Yes' button is clicked to confirm the deletion of the item 'Sample Todo' from the list.
