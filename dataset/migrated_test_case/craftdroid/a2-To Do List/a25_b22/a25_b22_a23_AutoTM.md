#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the source test case is in the process of adding a new item to a shopping list and verifying its addition. Given the executed action sequence, we have successfully completed the following steps from the source test case:

1. Click on the 'Add' button to create a new item in the shopping list. (Executed successfully)
2. Input the description 'Sample Todo' for the new item. (Executed successfully)

The next step in the source test case is to confirm the addition of the new item by clicking a 'Done' button. Let's find a matching action from the current page's intentions that corresponds to confirming the addition of a new task:

Looking at the list of intentions, the action that corresponds to confirming the addition of a new task in the target app is:

ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/bt_new_task_ok, (199, 464), click, "Okay"): After clicking on the 'Okay' button, it saves the current task.

Since we've already matched the addition and naming of the task to actions in the target app, we should proceed with the confirmation step by clicking the 'Okay' button. Here's the next action to perform:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/bt_new_task_ok, (199, 464), click, NULL): Confirm the addition of the new task.
~~~

This action should correspond to step 3 of the source test case. After this, we will need to assert the presence of the new task and then proceed with the deletion verification steps.
Based on the instructions and the given 'Actions', the Uiautomator2 code generated is:

···
d.click(199, 464)
d.click(199, 464)
···
Here d is the Uiautomator2 device variable, and click() is the method to simulate a tap on the Android device screen at the coordinates (199, 464).

Based on the provided source test case semantics, current page's intent description, and the executed action sequence, it seems we have successfully migrated the first three steps of the source test case to the target app. The next step is to verify that the "Sample Todo" text is present, indicating that the task has been added. 

Looking at the current page's intentions, we can see that the text of the task is represented by the TextView with id "org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name". Therefore, we can assert that the "Sample Todo" task has been added by checking the presence of this text in the TextView.

Here is the next step of the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name, (55, 90), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds, indicating the item has been added.
~~~
```python
assert d(text="Sample Todo").wait(timeout=10)
```

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the source test case has completed the steps of adding a new item to the shopping list, entering its description, confirming the addition, and verifying the addition through an assertion. The next step in the source test case is to swipe to delete the item.

The executed action sequence on the target application shows that a new task has been added with the name 'Sample Todo', and the presence of this task has been verified successfully.

The next step is to match the action of swiping to delete the item from the source test case to an equivalent action in the target application. Looking at the current page's intent description, the closest match for deleting an item seems to be a long click on the TextView element with the id 'org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name' which brings up options to modify or delete the task.

Here's the next action to perform based on the current state:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name, (55, 90), long click, "Sample Todo"): Long click to bring up options for modifying or deleting the task.
~~~

This action should bring up a dialog or popup menu with the option to delete the task named "Sample Todo". Once the option to delete is selected and the task is deleted, we would then need to verify that the task is no longer visible, similar to the assertion in step 6 of the source test case. However, since we are proceeding step-by-step, the verification will be part of the next action after confirming the delete option is successfully executed.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it seems like we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case to the target application. Now, we need to proceed with the fifth step of the source test case, which involves swiping right on the item 'Sample Todo' to delete it.

However, in the target application, the deletion of a task is done through a different method. In the target application, after a long click on the task, a dialog with options appears, allowing to edit and delete the task items. The 'Delete To-Do Task' option is actionable and can be clicked to delete the task.

So, the next step to be executed in the target application should be to click on the 'Delete To-Do Task' option from the dialog that appears after a long click on the task. This can be represented as follows:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (40, 425), click, "Delete To-Do Task"): Click to delete the 'Sample Todo' task.
~~~
Certainly, below is the uiautomator2 code for the given action using the device variable name `d`:

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it seems we've successfully migrated the steps from the source test case to the target application. We've added a new task, entered its description, confirmed the addition, and then deleted the task, verifying each step. 

However, the deletion operation in the source app was a swipe, but in the target app, it was a long click followed by a click on the Delete option. This is a good example of how operational logic may differ between applications, even of the same type.

The final step of the source test case is to verify that the task was successfully deleted. Therefore, the next step in the migration would be to assert that the task is no longer visible.

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name, (55, 90), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is no longer visible within 10 seconds, indicating the item has been deleted.
~~~
The provided input describes an assertion check for the visibility of text within a specified element, and indicates that the 'Sample Todo' text should no longer be visible after 10 seconds, inferring that there should be a check to ensure the item has been deleted.

Please note that in UIAutomator2, there isn't a ready-made function that asserts invisibility of a text within a given timeout. Instead, we'd typically wait for a condition to be met using `wait` functions, and catch an exception if the condition isn't met within the specified time frame. 

In Python using UIAutomator2, asserting that an element is no longer visible can be done using a `wait` function with a timeout, after which we would check for the element's presence or absence. Here's how to do it:

```python
import uiautomator2 as u2
import time

# Connect to the device
d = u2.connect('ip')

# Start with a check right away to avoid unnecessary waiting if the element is already gone.
if not d(resourceId="org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name", text="Sample Todo").exists(timeout=10):
    print("The 'Sample Todo' text is no longer visible immediately.")
else:
    # Wait for the specified element to disappear.
    start_time = time.time()
    while time.time() - start_time < 10:
        if not d(resourceId="org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name", text="Sample Todo").exists():
            print("The 'Sample Todo' text is no longer visible within 10 seconds.")
            break
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Sleep briefly to avoid busy-waiting.
    else:
        raise Exception("The 'Sample Todo' text is still visible after 10 seconds.")
```

Please remember to adapt the IP address and to replace the `print` statement and the `Exception` raising with the appropriate code for your specific test environment. The above code snippet is a template on how to handle this particular case and should be integrated into your test suite accordingly.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, "", (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the navigation menu. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a menu appears. The new menu has options such as "All tasks" with id "org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/design_menu_item_text", and "Settings" with id "org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/design_menu_item_text".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), long click, NULL): Invokes the main navigation menu. A long click on this button does not navigate to a new page, but rather expands the additional menu options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/fab_new_task, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new task. No new page is loaded, implying the same page is potentially updated to allow the user to input details for a new task.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/ac_add, (232, 28), long click, NULL): Long click to display list options. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog/popup which includes edit and delete item options appears.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/ac_add, (232, 28), click, NULL): Click to add a new To-Do list. Clicking this control navigates to a page where a new To-Do list can be created, with an input field for the list name (EditText with id "org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/et_todo_list_name") and options to cancel ("org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/bt_newtodolist_cancel") or confirm ("org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/bt_newtodolist_ok") the creation.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open the options menu. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a list view with various sorting and filter options appears, including "Group by priority" and "Sort by deadline" both with associated checkboxes.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), long_click, NULL): Long-click to open more options. No new page is navigated, but a popupMenu appears with additional settings or functionalities related to the To-Do list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_empty_view_no_tasks, (0, 80), click, "No tasks available"): Click to refresh or indicate no tasks available. No navigation occurs; the state of the page remains with "No tasks available" message displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_empty_view_no_tasks, (0, 80), long_click, "No tasks available"): Long click to open context menu for tasks management. No difference detected between Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON after the interaction, indicating the long click action does not navigate to a new page or cause the appearance of new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/initial_alert, (162, 96), click, "CLICK + FOR NEW LIST"): Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but suggests user action to create a new list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/initial_alert, (162, 96), long_click, "CLICK + FOR NEW LIST"): Long click to prompt adding a new list. Since interaction does not result in a new page and there is no difference between Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON, it indicates that the long click potentially triggers an in-page event such as a tooltip or a popup without navigating away or altering the currently visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/second_alert, (107, 587), click, "ADD NEW TASK >"): Clicking on this button does not lead to a new page. The widgets remain the same as prior to the click. The user intent is to add a new task but it requires further interaction or fulfillment of a certain condition.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/second_alert, (107, 587), longClick, "ADD NEW TASK >"): Long Clicking on the "ADD NEW TASK >" widget doesn't navigate to a new page and no new widgets appear.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/fab_new_task, (248, 568), long click, NULL): Opens task creation interface. After a long click, a dialog for adding a new To-Do task is presented, including fields for 'Name', 'Description', options for 'Deadline', 'Reminder', 'Priority', and a 'List' selection with buttons to 'Cancel' or confirm with 'Okay'.
