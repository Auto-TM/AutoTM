#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the beginning of the test case migration. The first step in the source test case has been executed successfully in the target app. Now, we need to proceed with entering the text for the new todo item. Here's the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, douzifly.list:id/edit_text, (10, 24), input, "Sample Todo"):Enter the text "Sample Todo" into the title input field for the new item
~~~

This action corresponds to the second step in the source test case where we input the text "Sample Todo" into the todo item input field. In the target app, we have a separate field for the title, so we'll use that to enter our sample text. The content field can be left empty for now, as it wasn't part of the original test case.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the specified action:

···
d(resourceId="douzifly.list:id/edit_text").set_text("Sample Todo")
···

This code uses the unique resource ID of the EditText widget to set the text "Sample Todo" into the title input field for the new item. This approach is preferred when we have a reliable widget ID, as it's more robust than using coordinates for text input operations.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears we are in the process of migrating a test case for adding a new todo item. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. In the source test case, we've completed the first two steps: clicking the add button and entering the text "Sample Todo".
2. In the target app, we've also performed these two actions successfully.

The next step in the source test case is to save the new todo item. However, in the target app, we don't see a specific save button in the current page's intentions. This suggests that the saving mechanism might be different in the target app.

Given this information, let's proceed with the next logical step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, douzifly.list:id/edit_text_content, (10, 68), click, NULL):Click to focus on the content input field to complete the item creation
~~~

This action serves two purposes:
1. It completes the item creation process by interacting with another field, which might trigger an automatic save.
2. It allows us to potentially add content to the todo item, which wasn't explicitly part of the source test case but could be a feature of the target app.

After this action, we should verify if the item has been successfully added to the list. If it has, we can proceed with the next steps of the test case. If not, we might need to explore other options to save the item.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d(resourceId="douzifly.list:id/edit_text_content").click()
···

This code uses the resourceId to locate the EditText element and performs a click action to focus on the content input field. This approach is preferred when the widget ID is available and unique, as it's more reliable than using coordinates.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we can determine that we are currently at the step of adding a new todo item in the target application. The next logical step would be to save or confirm the addition of the new item. Let's proceed with the following action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, douzifly.list:id/fab_add, (238, 512), click, NULL):Click on the add button to save and add the new todo item
~~~

This action corresponds to the "Click on the save button to add the new todo item" step in the source test case. In the target application, it appears that the same button used for initiating the add process (fab_add) is also used for confirming the addition. This is a common pattern in many todo applications.

After this action, we should verify that the new item has been added successfully. We'll need to wait for the next set of intentions to confirm this and proceed with the next step of the test case migration.
Based on the provided action description, here's the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python:

···
d.click(238, 512)
···

This code uses the coordinates (238, 512) to click on the add button, as specified in the action description. This is the optimal choice since precise coordinates are provided and it's a simple click action.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully added a new todo item with the title "Sample Todo" in the target application. The next step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the newly added item. Let's proceed with this verification:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (35, 99), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"):Verify that the newly added todo item with text "Sample Todo" is present within 10 seconds
~~~

This assertion checks for the presence of the newly added todo item "Sample Todo" in the list. The element used for this assertion is the TextView with id "douzifly.list:id/txt_thing", which seems to be the element displaying the todo item text in the target application.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the presence of the newly added todo item:

···
assert d(resourceId="douzifly.list:id/txt_thing", text="Sample Todo").wait(timeout=10), "Text 'Sample Todo' not found within 10 seconds"
···

This code uses the `resourceId` and `text` attributes to locate the specific TextView element, and then waits for up to 10 seconds for the element to appear. If the element is not found within the timeout period, an assertion error will be raised.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully added a new todo item "Sample Todo" and verified its presence. The next step in the source test case is to remove this item through a swipe action. Let's proceed with this step using the available intentions on the current page.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (35, 99), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"):Swipe right on the todo item "Sample Todo" from [43, 99] to [264, 121] to reveal the delete option
~~~

This action corresponds to the swipe right operation in the source test case. In the target app, swiping right reveals a delete option, which aligns with the goal of removing the todo item. After this action, we should see a delete button appear.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the swipe action:

···
d.swipe(43, 99, 264, 121)
···

This code uses the precise coordinates provided in the action description to perform a swipe from left to right, revealing the delete option for the "Sample Todo" item. The swipe starts at (43, 99) and ends at (264, 121), which should correspond to the gesture of swiping the todo item to the right.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we have successfully migrated the first five steps of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to remove the todo item by swiping right. However, in the target application, swiping right has revealed a delete option rather than directly deleting the item. Therefore, we need to complete the deletion process by clicking on the revealed delete button. Here's the next action to take:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, douzifly.list:id/btn_delete, (10, 81), click, "DELETE"):Click on the delete button to remove the "Sample Todo" item from the list
~~~

This action should complete the deletion process that was initiated by the swipe action in the previous step. After this, we should verify that the item has been removed, which corresponds to the last step in the source test case.
Based on the provided action description, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the requested operation:

···
d.click(10, 81)
···

This code uses the coordinate-based click operation, which is the preferred method as per the requirements. The code clicks on the delete button located at coordinates (10, 81) to remove the "Sample Todo" item from the list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated most of the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's analyze the current situation and determine the next step:

1. We've added a new todo item "Sample Todo".
2. We've verified its presence.
3. We've swiped right to reveal the delete option.
4. We've clicked the delete button to remove the item.

The next logical step would be to verify that the item has been removed, which corresponds to the last step in the source test case. Here's the appropriate action:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (35, 99), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"):Verify that the todo item with text "Sample Todo" is no longer visible within 10 seconds
DONE
~~~

This assertion checks if the "Sample Todo" item is no longer visible in the list, which aligns with the last step of the source test case. If this assertion passes, it means we have successfully completed all steps of the test case migration.

The "DONE" statement indicates that we have successfully matched and migrated all steps from the source test case to the target application. We've covered adding a new todo item, verifying its presence, removing it through a swipe and delete action, and finally verifying its removal.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given action:

···
import time

start_time = time.time()
timeout = 10  # 10 seconds timeout

while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
    if not d(resourceId="douzifly.list:id/txt_thing", text="Sample Todo").exists():
        break
    time.sleep(0.5)

assert not d(resourceId="douzifly.list:id/txt_thing", text="Sample Todo").exists(), "The 'Sample Todo' item is still visible after 10 seconds"
···

This code implements a wait and assert mechanism to verify that the todo item with text "Sample Todo" is no longer visible within 10 seconds. It uses a loop to check for the existence of the element every 0.5 seconds, breaking the loop if the element disappears. If the element is still visible after 10 seconds, an assertion error is raised.
