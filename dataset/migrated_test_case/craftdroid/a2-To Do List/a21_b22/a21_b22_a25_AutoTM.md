#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence, we have successfully migrated the first four steps of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to swipe right on the 'Sample Todo' item to remove it. 

Looking at the current page's intent description, the equivalent action in the target app could be achieved by swiping right on the 'Sample Todo' item as well. This action is represented by the following intention:

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description, (12, 92), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"): Swipe to right. from:[20, 92] to:[204, 122] to modify the item. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the item is removed from the shopping list.

Let's perform this action to continue the test case migration. 

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description, (12, 92), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"): Swipe right on the 'Sample Todo' item to remove it.
~~~
### Output(The code should be wrapped using '···'):

Based on your actions, the expected uiautomator2 code would be given as follows:

···
# Swipe to right on the 'Sample Todo' control to modify the item
d.swipe(20, 92, 204, 122)

# Swipe right on the 'Sample Todo' item to remove it
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description").swipe("right")
···
The coordinates provided in your input were used to generate the swipe action in the first line. For the second action, since no specific coordinates were provided, the swipe is completed on the control identified by the resourceId. The direction "right" is used as mentioned in your action description to generate the swipe action.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (24, 298), click, "Remove all checked items?"): Click to confirm the removal of all checked items. Clicking this prompts a dialog with options "Cancel" and "OK".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (24, 298), long_click, NULL): Long click to open options for managing checked items. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog with options "Cancel" with id "android:id/button2" and "OK" with id "android:id/button1".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (24, 298), swipe_to_right, NULL): Swipe to right. from:[32, 298] to:[304, 320] to confirm the removal of all checked items. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely triggers the removal action as the same dialog with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons remains after the swipe.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (24, 298), swipe_to_left, "Remove all checked items?"): Swipe to left. from:[304, 320] to:[32, 298] to initiate the removal process. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the same dialog remains visible with the options 'Cancel' and 'OK' to confirm or cancel the removal operation.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 332), click, "Cancel"): Click to cancel the removal of all checked items. No new page appears after this action, the user is returned back to the "Shopping List" page. The returned page has controls like delete checked items with id "com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/action_delete_checked" and more options represented by an ImageView with clickable and longClickable controls. Additionally, it represents new item description and quantity fields with id's "com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description" and "com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_quantity" respectively.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (143, 332), longClick, "Cancel"): The long clicking operation ensures the cancellation of the action which is supposed to remove all checked items. Navigates back to the shopping list page after cancellation.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 332), click, "OK"): The button serves to remove all checked items when clicked. After the click, the page navigates back to the Shopping List main page.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (220, 332), long click, "OK"): Long press to confirm removal of all checked items. This action does not navigate to a new page, but it presumably triggers the removal of items from the list on the current page, as no changes in GUI elements are observed between the current and next page JSON data.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description, (12, 92), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is not visible within 10 seconds, indicating that the to-do item has been removed.
~~~
Based on the provided information, here is the transformed UIAutomator2 code in python:

### Output:

```python
import time
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    element_text = d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description").get_text()
    if 'Sample Todo' not in element_text:
        break
    time.sleep(1)
assert 'Sample Todo' not in element_text
```
In this code, we're checking for the non-appearance of 'Sample Todo' text in the 'text_description' TextView element within a 10 second period, and the assert statement will verify this. Please modify the id as per actual requirements.
