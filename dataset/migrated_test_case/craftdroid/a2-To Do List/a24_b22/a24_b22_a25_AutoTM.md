### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is testing the functionality of adding a new todo list, deleting it, and verifying its deletion in the SimplyDo Android application.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (), input, "Sample Todo") : Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'New List Name' field and hide the keyboard.
> 2. ACTION (Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Add' button to add the new todo list.
> 3. ASSERT (TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds, indicating the todo list has been added.
> 4. ACTION (TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (), long_press, NULL) : Long press on the 'Sample Todo' list to bring up the options menu.
> 5. ACTION (TextView, android:id/title, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Delete' option to delete the 'Sample Todo' list.
> 6. ACTION (Button, android:id/button1, (), click, NULL) : Confirm the deletion by clicking on the 'Yes' button in the confirmation dialog.
> 7. ASSERT (, , (), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is not visible within 10 seconds, indicating the todo list has been deleted.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "Navigate up" button to open the navigation drawer. The new page introduces options represented by the 'Lists' tittle, and a clickable ListView under the id 'com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/nav_drawer_content', which includes the 'Shopping List' option.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, Navigate up, (0, 24), long click, NULL): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, no additional widgets appear. This implies that the action might be used to select the item for further actions or trigger a contextual menu.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Shopping List, (72, 38), click, NULL): The 'Shopping List' button was clicked, but no new page appears or new widgets show up. Instead, the current page is refreshed. The actions indicate that clicking the 'Shopping List' button refreshes the same page.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView, [0, 80], long_click, NULL): Long press to perform actions related to shopping list items. Long pressing on this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely invokes a contextual action mode or selection mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Shopping List, (72, 38), swipe_to_right, NULL): Swipe to right. from:[80, 38] to:[201, 66] to delete items from the shopping list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new item to the shopping list. This action corresponds to the first step of the source test case where we input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'New List Name' field.
~~~
To convert the given action into uiautomator2 code, it would be:

#### Input:
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new item to the shopping list. This action corresponds to the first step of the source test case where we input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'New List Name' field.

#### Output(The code should be wrapped using '···'):
```python
d.click(248, 568)
```
This output model suggests that we are clicking on the coordinates (248, 568) on the android device, which correspond to the 'fab_add' button (resource id: com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add). It's a feasible choice to operate based on coordinates as they are precise in this scenario.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description, (2, 342), input, "Sample Todo"): Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'New Item' field.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/button_add_new_item, (242, 388), click, NULL): Click on the 'Done' button to add the new item to the shopping list.
ASSERT (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView, (0, 80), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within the shopping list, indicating the item has been added.
~~~
Here's how those actions and assertions can be translated into Python code that uses uiautomator2:

```python
# Inputting 'Sample Todo' into 'New Item'
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description").send_keys("Sample Todo")

# Click on 'Done' button
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/button_add_new_item").click()

# Verifying if 'Sample Todo' is present in the shopping list
assert "Sample Todo" in d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView").get_text()
```
Please ensure that the device variable in your actual code matches with the one used in these examples. Make sure to wait for the UI to update before performing the assertion. If needed, you can include a delay before the assertion like so:

```python
import time
time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second
```
This completes the UIAutomator2 code generation based on the provided action sequences.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given the executed action sequence, it appears that the first three steps of the source test case have been successfully completed in the target application. The actions performed correspond to adding a new item to the shopping list and verifying its presence, which matches the first part of the source test case semantics.

The next step in the source test case is to long press on the 'Sample Todo' list to bring up the options menu. In the current page's intentions, the closest action that can be interpreted as bringing up options for an item is the long click on the `android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView` with the id `com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView`. However, the description suggests that this action might not bring up a menu but rather initiate item edit or contextual action mode.

Since the intention descriptions do not explicitly mention a deletion action through a menu, we may need to look for a swipe action that corresponds to the deletion of an item. There is an intention that describes swiping to delete an item: `ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description, (12, 92), swipe_to_right, NULL): Swipe to right from:[20, 92] to:[204, 122] to delete the item.` This matches the functionality we are looking for in step 5 of the source test case, which is to delete the 'Sample Todo' list.

We will proceed by performing the swipe action to delete the item 'Sample Todo' and then verify its deletion as per steps 5 and 7 of the source test case.

Here is the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description, (12, 92), swipe_to_right, NULL): Swipe to right from:[20, 92] to:[204, 122] to delete the 'Sample Todo' item.
ASSERT (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView, (), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is not visible within 10 seconds, indicating the item has been deleted.
~~~
Based on your given action parameters and requirements, the converted Uiautomator2 code is as follows:

```python
# ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description, (12, 92), swipe_to_right, NULL)
d.swipe(20, 92, 204, 122)

# ASSERT (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView, (), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo")
import time
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    if not d(text="Sample Todo").exists():
        break
    time.sleep(1)
assert not d(text="Sample Todo").exists()
```

Make sure your device is connected appropriately and the coordinates used for actions are within the device screen range. Perform the swipe action on the specified TextView and then ensure the 'Sample Todo' text is no longer visible on the screen within 10 seconds.
