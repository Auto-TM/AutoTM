### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, null, (0, 365), none, "You don't have any todos"): The widget is not clicked and does not influence changes in GUI page elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, You don't have any todos, (0, 365), longClick, NULL): Triggering a long click doesn't navigate to a new page or reveal any new elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "You don't have any todos", (0, 365), swipe_to_right, "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to right. from:[0, 365] to:[320, 399] but no change on the page. No new dialog or page appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, No ID, (0, 365), swipe_to_left from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365], "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to left. from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365] does not lead to any navigation or appearance of new elements. It seems this action does not trigger any reactions on the page as the current page and the next page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), click, "Minimal"): Click to interact but no new page or widgets appear after the interaction, which indicates that this element may be non-interactive or may serve a cosmetic purpose.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), longClick, NULL): Long-click to open a context menu on the current page, where there aren't any new widgets or pages provided after the interaction. The next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON, suggesting that there may be no significant GUI differences in the transition.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe, "Minimal"): Swipe to right from:[16, 38] to:[88, 66] target element does not seem to cause major changes or navigation to a new page, as the GUI elements on the next page JSON data remain the same as the current page JSON. This likely signifies that the swipe action on this widget does not significantly alter the GUI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe_to_left, "Minimal"): Swipe to left. from:[88, 66] to:[16, 38] does not make any observable changes. The page components remain the same as before.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, More options, (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open additional options. The page after clicking this control shows a list with "Settings" and "About" options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, More options, (280, 28), longClickable, NULL): Long press on the 'More options' button. Long pressing on this control opens a settings page where user can change app settings like 'Night Mode'. The settings page contains choices like 'Night mode is off' that can be clicked or checked.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add new TODO item. The next page after clicking on this control is the TODO creation page, which has a text entry field with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText" for the ToDo title, a reminder setup with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/todoReminderAndDateContainerLayout", and a confirm button with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), long click, NULL): Long click to create a new todo. The page after the interaction is the create todo page, which includes a title input field with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText", a remind me option with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoHasDateSwitchCompat" and a save button with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the given information, the first step in the source test case is to input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'New List Name' field and hide the keyboard. 

According to the current page's intentions, the operation that matches this action is 'ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add new TODO item.' which navigates to the TODO creation page that contains a text entry field for the ToDo title. 

So, the next step in the migration should be to click the 'addToDoItemFAB' ImageButton to navigate to the TODO creation page, and then input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'userToDoEditText' field. 

Here is the migration step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), click, NULL): Navigate to the TODO creation page.
ACTION (EditText, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText, (), input, "Sample Todo") : Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the 'New List Name' field and hide the keyboard.
~~~
Here is the conversion of the Actions into UIAutomator2 code:

```python
d.click(248, 568)
d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText").set_text("Sample Todo")
d.press('back')
```

In this code, the first line simulates clicking the ImageButton element located at (248, 568) coordinates, which is used to navigate to the TODO creation page. 
The second line is used to input the text "Sample Todo" into the EditText field with the id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText". 
The third line simulates pressing the back button to hide the keyboard.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, Navigate up, (0, 24), click, NULL): Navigates up leaving the current page. The subsequent page is a to-do list that currently does not have any to-dos, with an add button with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB" available for user interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), longClick, NULL): Long clicking on the 'navigate up' button to navigate back to the previous page. After the operation, the current page shows the to-do list with a message - "You don't have any todos". This indicates that the previous action might have deleted a 'to-do' item or it has returned to an empty list page.
ACTION (bq, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoCustomTextInput, (0, 121), click, "Title"): The intent of this interaction is to edit the 'Title' of the 'ToDo' item. It seems that the action does not navigate to a new page or produce any new widgets. After clicking on this EditText, it is supposed to allow the user to edit the text and write their own custom 'ToDo' item's title.
ACTION (bq, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoCustomTextInput, (0, 121), long_click, "Title"): The long click on the 'Title' text input field does not navigate to a new page or make any new widgets appear. All the elements and their attributes remain unchanged after the action.
ACTION (bq, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoCustomTextInput, (0, 121), swipe_to_right, "Title"): Swipe to right. from:[0, 121] to:[320, 179] to review the task. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, no new elements were introduced.
ACTION (bq, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoCustomTextInput, (0, 121), swipe_to_left, "Sample Todo"): Swipe to left. from:[320, 179] to:[0, 121] to navigate to the next field. After swiping, no new page or widget appears. Therefore, the action does not trigger new elements or events.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText, (32, 133), click, "Sample Todo"): Clicking on this EditText field is to edit/enter the todo item title. No new page or widget appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText, (32, 133), long_click, 'Sample Todo'): Long click to open the editing options menu. After performing this operation, options to 'Cut', 'Copy', 'Paste' the text and 'More options' become available.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/todoReminderAndDateContainerLayout, (0, 220), click, NULL): Click the layout to set Reminder. Clicking on this control doesn't navigate to a new page, but a reminder setup sub-menu should appear. According to next JSON data, no new widget appears or no widget state was changed. Please verify if this interaction behaves as expected on the application.
ACTION (android.widget.LinearLayout, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/todoReminderAndDateContainerLayout, (0, 220), long click, NULL): Long Click to open more options for reminder and date setting.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence, the next step in the migration process would be to delete the 'Sample Todo' list. In the source application, this is achieved by long pressing on the 'Sample Todo' list to bring up the options menu, and then clicking on the 'Delete' option. However, the target application does not seem to have a similar functionality. 

In the target application, the deletion of a todo list item can be achieved by swiping the todo item to the right or left. Therefore, the next step in the migration process would be to swipe the 'Sample Todo' list item to the right or left to delete it. 

Here is the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview, (77, 101), swipe_to_right, "Sample Todo"): Swipe to right. from:[77, 101] to:[320, 123] to delete the Todo item.
~~~
Based on the given requirements and the actions to be carried out, here is the converted UIAutomator2 code for the corresponding input.

In this case, the action is to swipe to right, from:[77, 101] to:[320, 123] to delete the Todo item. The coordinates are provided and specific, so we use the swipe function here.

### Output

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/snackbar_text, (12, 614), wait_until_text_presence, "Deleted Todo") : Verify that the text 'Deleted Todo' is present within 10 seconds, indicating the todo list has been deleted.

Based on the requirements and prior actions, the Python UIAutomator2 code would be:
    
···
import time
for i in range(10):
    if d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/snackbar_text").exists and d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/snackbar_text").get_text() == "Deleted Todo":
        break
    time.sleep(1)
else:
    assert False, "'Deleted Todo' text did not appear in 10sec"
···

This Python UIAutomatior2 code makes use of a for loop which runs for 10 iterations (1 iteration per second for 10 seconds). On every iteration, it checks whether the UI element with the resourceId "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/snackbar_text" exists and whether its text content is "Deleted Todo". If the conditions are met, it breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without the conditions being met, it asserts False, providing an error message "'Deleted Todo' text did not appear in 10sec". Hence, it successfully verifies that the text 'Deleted Todo' is present within 10 seconds, indicating that the todo list has been deleted.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, null, (0, 365), none, "You don't have any todos"): The widget is not clicked and does not influence changes in GUI page elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, You don't have any todos, (0, 365), longClick, NULL): Triggering a long click doesn't navigate to a new page or reveal any new elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "You don't have any todos", (0, 365), swipe_to_right, "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to right. from:[0, 365] to:[320, 399] but no change on the page. No new dialog or page appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, No ID, (0, 365), swipe_to_left from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365], "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to left. from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365] does not lead to any navigation or appearance of new elements. It seems this action does not trigger any reactions on the page as the current page and the next page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), click, "Minimal"): Click to interact but no new page or widgets appear after the interaction, which indicates that this element may be non-interactive or may serve a cosmetic purpose.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), longClick, NULL): Long-click to open a context menu on the current page, where there aren't any new widgets or pages provided after the interaction. The next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON, suggesting that there may be no significant GUI differences in the transition.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe, "Minimal"): Swipe to right from:[16, 38] to:[88, 66] target element does not seem to cause major changes or navigation to a new page, as the GUI elements on the next page JSON data remain the same as the current page JSON. This likely signifies that the swipe action on this widget does not significantly alter the GUI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe_to_left, "Minimal"): Swipe to left. from:[88, 66] to:[16, 38] does not make any observable changes. The page components remain the same as before.
