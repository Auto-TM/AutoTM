#### Selected Event(s) and Script

Based on the provided source test case semantics, current page intentions, and executed action sequence, it seems that we have successfully completed step 1 of the source test case. The next step would be to confirm the creation of the new todo task by clicking on a button similar to the 'fab_add' button in the source app.

Looking at the current page's intentions, there doesn't seem to be a direct match for the 'AddListButton' from the source application. However, there is a mention of a 'fab_add' button, which could potentially serve the same purpose. 

Given this information, the next step would be to click on the 'fab_add' button to confirm the creation of the new todo task. Here is the corresponding action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, douzifly.list:id/fab_add, (238, 308), click, NULL): Click on the 'fab_add' button to confirm the creation of the new todo task.
~~~
Based on the given input, the optimal output, according to the specified format, would be:

···
d(resourceId="douzifly.list:id/fab_add").click()
···
This output is based on the given direction to prefer using coordinates if they are precise. However, as the ID is unique and non-empty, it is also fine to use the ID. Therefore, the above code simply clicks on the "fab_add" button as instructed.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence, you have successfully migrated the first two steps of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the 'Sample Todo' task has been added. 

To achieve this, we can assert the presence of the 'Sample Todo' task by checking the text of the TextView element with id 'douzifly.list:id/txt_thing'. 

Here is the next step of your test migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (35, 99), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds, indicating the todo task has been added.
~~~
Based on your request, here is the converted UIAutomator2 Python code:

···
assert d(text="Sample Todo").wait(timeout=10000)
···
The code above waits for a TextView widget containing 'Sample Todo' text to be present within 10 seconds and then asserts its presence. The `wait` function by default will wait for 10 seconds before it either finds the widget or times out.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script

~~~
ASSERT (, , (), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is not visible within 10 seconds, indicating the todo list has been deleted.
DONE

Based on the given inputs, as 'wait_until_text_invisible' attribute is not supported directly in UIAutomator2, we can use a while loop with a timeout counter to achieve this. Here 'Sample Todo' text is the target whose disappearance should be verified within the 10-second interval. We assume the frequency of checking the element presence is every second.

Here's the Python UIAutomator2 code for the given scenario:

···
import time

timeout = 10  # Timeout set for 10 seconds.
start_time = time.time()

while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
    if not d(text='Sample Todo').exists():
        break
    time.sleep(1)  # Waiting for a second before checking again.
else:
    raise AssertionError("The visibility of text 'Sample Todo' has not changed after 10 seconds.")
···

This code will verify whether 'Sample Todo' text becomes invisible within a 10-second interval. If not, it throws an AssertionError indicating the required change has not taken place within the expected time.
