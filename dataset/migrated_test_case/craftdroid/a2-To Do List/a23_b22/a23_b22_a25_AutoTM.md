#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the first step in the source test case is to click on the 'Skip' button to bypass the tutorial. However, there is no 'Skip' button in the current page's intentions. We can consider this step as not applicable in the target app and proceed to the next step.

The second step in the source test case is to click on the 'New Task' button to create a new to-do task. In the current page's intentions, there is an action to click on a button to add a new item to the shopping list, which is functionally similar. 

So, the next step in the migration would be to click on the 'Add' button to create a new item in the shopping list. 

Here is the output:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new item to the shopping list.
~~~
### Output:
Based on your actions description, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be as follows:

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the source test case semantics and the executed action sequence, we are currently on the step of inputting the task name. In the source app, this is achieved by inputting into an EditText field. In the target app, a similar action can be performed on the EditText field with the ID "com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description". Therefore, the next action to be performed is:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description, (2, 502), input, "Sample Todo"): Inputting the name 'Sample Todo' for the new task.
~~~
Based on given information:

The name of the UIAutomator2 device variable is: d

The Action provided is: 
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description, (2, 502), input, "Sample Todo"): Inputting the name 'Sample Todo' for the new task.

And following the instructions above, the conversion of this action into UIAutomator2 code would be:

```python
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description").clear_text()
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description").set_text('Sample Todo')
d.press('enter')
```

In the code above, we first clear any existing text in the EditText identified by its resource ID com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description . Then we set the text to 'Sample Todo' using the set_text() method. Finally, we simulate the press of the 'enter' key on the software keyboard to confirm the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided details, the test case from the source application is about creating a new to-do task and then deleting it. The current page's intention in the target application seems to be a shopping list application where items can be added, edited, and deleted.

The source test case has reached step 3, where the 'Sample Todo' task name has been entered. The executed action sequence in the target application indicates that a new item has been added and the name 'Sample Todo' has been input successfully.

The next step in the source application would be to confirm the creation of the new task (step 4). Looking at the current page's intentions in the target application, the closest match for confirming the addition of an item would be clicking the button to add the new item to the list.

Therefore, the next action to migrate would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/button_add_new_item, (242, 548), click, NULL): Clicking on this control adds a new item 'Sample Todo' in the list.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 4 of the source test case, which is clicking the 'Okay' button to confirm the creation of the new task. After this action, we would need to assert that the item has been added to the list, which would correspond to step 5 in the source test case. However, since the current page's intentions do not include a direct assertion action, we'll assume that the addition of the item can be visually confirmed by its presence in the RecyclerView list.

If the next step is to verify the presence of the 'Sample Todo' item, we would look for an action that allows us to assert or check the existence of the item in the list. If such an action is not available, we might not be able to perform a direct migration of this assertion step. However, assuming the UI reflects the addition, the presence of 'Sample Todo' in the RecyclerView can be considered a visual confirmation.

Since the source test case also includes steps for deleting a task and verifying its deletion, we need to look at the intentions for a matching delete action. The closest match is the swipe to left action on the TextView with the description, which removes the item from the list.

We will proceed with the migration step by step, so the next step to match would be the addition confirmation. If there's an intention that allows us to assert the addition visually, we would use that, otherwise, we will assume the UI update as the confirmation.
Based on your instructions and given the action:

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/button_add_new_item, (242, 548), click, NULL): Clicking on this control adds a new item 'Sample Todo' in the list.

Here is the corresponding UIAutomator2 code:

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/text_description, (12, 92), swipe_to_right, NULL): Swipe to right. from:[20, 92] to:[204, 122] to interact with the item. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the item is removed from the shopping list.
~~~
To convert the action into UIAutomator2 code, you can use the swipe method in UIAutomator2. The swipe method has four parameters: starting coordinate (from_x, from_y) and end coordinate (to_x, to_y). However, since the input does not provide the ending coordinate, we need to infer. Considering that a typical swipe to the right would mean a horizontal change in the x-coordinate, we move a certain amount, say 100 units, to the right for this case. 

### Output:

```python
d.swipe(20, 92, 204, 112)
```
