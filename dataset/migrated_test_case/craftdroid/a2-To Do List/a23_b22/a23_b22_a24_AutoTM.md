### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click on the title "Simply Do". This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, as the page content remains the same after the interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), long_click, "Simply Do"): Long click on the title "Simply Do". This action does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes in the UI elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), swipe_to_right, "Simply Do"): Swipe to right from [14, 25] to [322, 47]. This action does not result in any visible changes to the page or introduce new elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), swipe_to_left, "Simply Do"): Swipe to left from [322, 47] to [14, 25] on the title bar. This action does not lead to any changes in the page layout or new elements appearing.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, "New List Name"): Click to focus and enable text input for creating a new list. The page remains the same with an editable text field (id: kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText) and an "Add" button (id: kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton).
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), long_click, "New List Name"): Long click on the text input field to trigger text selection or context menu options. No new page or dialog appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click to add a new list. Clicking this button does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets, suggesting the action might have failed or requires input in the "New List Name" field first.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), long_click, "Add"): Long click on the Add button. This action does not navigate to a new page or create new widgets. The page remains unchanged after the long click.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are at the beginning of the test case migration. The source test case starts with bypassing a tutorial, but the target app doesn't seem to have a similar feature. Instead, we're presented with a page to create a new list. Let's start by creating a new list, which could be analogous to creating a new task in the source app.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), input, "Sample Todo"):Enter "Sample Todo" as the name of the new list
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, NULL):Click the "Add" button to create the new list
~~~

This action corresponds to steps 2, 3, and 4 in the source test case, where we create a new task. In the target app, we're creating a new list instead, but the functionality is similar. We're inputting the same text "Sample Todo" to maintain consistency with the source test case.
Based on the provided actions, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform these actions:

···
d(resourceId="kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText").set_text("Sample Todo")
d.click(273, 49)
···

This code does the following:
1. Enters "Sample Todo" into the EditText field with the specified resource ID.
2. Clicks the "Add" button using the provided coordinates (273, 49).

After swiping, the list view (kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView) is updated with more items, suggesting the deletion action triggered a refresh of the list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), swipe_to_left, "(0/0)"): Swipe to left from [328, 137] to [286, 113] to reveal options for the todo list item. After swiping, the ListView with id "kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView" now contains multiple todo list items, suggesting that the swipe action may have triggered the display of additional list items or options.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the source test case semantics, it appears that we have successfully created a new list named "Sample Todo" in the target application. This corresponds to steps 2, 3, and 4 in the source test case, where a new task is created.

The next logical step would be to verify that the newly created list is present. In the source test case, this is done in step 5. Let's adapt this step for our target application:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"):Verify that the newly created list with the text "Sample Todo" is present within 10 seconds.
~~~

This assertion checks for the presence of the "Sample Todo" text in the list view, which should correspond to the newly created list. If this assertion passes, we can proceed to the next step in our test case migration.
Based on the provided information, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the assertion:

···
assert d(resourceId="kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1", text="Sample Todo").wait(timeout=10), "Text 'Sample Todo' not found within 10 seconds"
···

This code will:
1. Look for an element with the resource ID "kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1" and text "Sample Todo".
2. Wait for up to 10 seconds for this element to appear.
3. If the element is found within the timeout period, the assertion passes.
4. If the element is not found within 10 seconds, the assertion will fail with the message "Text 'Sample Todo' not found within 10 seconds".

This approach uses the resource ID and text attributes for identification, which is generally more reliable than using coordinates, especially across different device sizes or orientations.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information and the executed action sequence, it appears that we have successfully created a new list named "Sample Todo" and added a task item with the same name "Sample Todo" to this list. Now, we need to proceed with the next step in the source test case, which is to verify the creation of the new task and then delete it. Let's continue with the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (12, 107), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"):Verify that the newly created task item with the text "Sample Todo" is present within 10 seconds.
~~~

This assertion step corresponds to step 5 in the source test case. We're verifying that the task we just created is visible in the list. After this assertion, we should proceed with the deletion of the task, which corresponds to steps 6, 7, and 8 in the source test case.
Based on the provided action and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python to verify the presence of the "Sample Todo" text:

···
assert d(resourceId="kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1", text="Sample Todo").wait(timeout=10), "Text 'Sample Todo' not found within 10 seconds"
···

This code uses the `wait` method with a timeout of 10 seconds to check for the presence of the specified text. The assertion will fail if the text is not found within the given timeout period.

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully created a new list named "Sample Todo" and added a task item with the same name "Sample Todo" to this list. The next step in the migration process should be to delete the created task item. Let's proceed with this step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (12, 107), swipe_to_left, "Sample Todo"):Swipe left on the "Sample Todo" task item to reveal delete option
~~~

This action corresponds to step 6 and 7 in the source test case, where a long click was used to open a menu and then select the delete option. In this target app, it appears that swiping left is the method to reveal options for deleting a task item. 

After executing this action, we should wait for your feedback on whether it was successful and what new options or UI elements it revealed. Based on that information, we can determine the next step to complete the deletion process.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given action:

···
d.swipe(12, 107, 0, 107)
···

This code performs a swipe action from left to right on the "Sample Todo" task item, starting from the coordinates (12, 107) and moving towards the left edge of the screen (x-coordinate 0). This action should reveal the delete option for the task item.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed action sequence and the current page's intent description, it appears that we have successfully created a new list and a new task item named "Sample Todo". The last action performed was a swipe left on the task item, which likely revealed options for the item. Now, we need to proceed with deleting the task item. According to the current page's intent description, we have an "Item Options" dialog open with various options including "Delete". Let's proceed with the deletion process.

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (25, 310), click, "Delete"):Click to delete the selected item.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 7 in the source test case, where we select the delete option. In the source app, this was done through a long press and then selecting "Delete To-Do Task", while in our target app, we've revealed the delete option through a swipe and now we're clicking it directly.
Here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python based on the given action:

···
d(text="Delete").click()
···

This code uses the text attribute to locate and click the "Delete" button, as it's the most reliable method given the information provided. The coordinate-based click is not used in this case because the text is confirmed and unique, making it a more robust selector.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, we are currently at the step of confirming the deletion of the "Sample Todo" task item. The source test case's step 7 (clicking on "Delete To-Do Task") has been executed, and we are now at a confirmation dialog. Let's proceed with the next step in the migration process:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (17, 374), click, "Yes"):Click the 'Yes' button to confirm deletion of the active item.

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (12, 107), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"):Verify that the task "Sample Todo" is no longer visible within 10 seconds, confirming its deletion.
~~~

This action corresponds to step 8 in the source test case, where we confirm the deletion and then verify that the task is no longer visible. The assertion is added to ensure that the deletion was successful, matching the verification step in the original test case.
Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python for the given actions:

···
d.click(17, 374)

assert d(resourceId="kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1", text="Sample Todo").wait_gone(timeout=10)
···

This code does the following:

1. Clicks the 'Yes' button at the specified coordinates (17, 374) to confirm the deletion of the active item.

2. Verifies that the task "Sample Todo" is no longer visible within 10 seconds, confirming its deletion. This is done using the `wait_gone` method with a timeout of 10 seconds.

The code uses coordinates for the click action as specified in the requirements, and uses the resourceId and text attributes for the assertion, as the text is confirmed in the input.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, it appears that we have successfully migrated all the steps from the source test case to the target application. Let's review the steps:

1. We created a new list named "Sample Todo".
2. We verified the creation of the list.
3. We opened the "Sample Todo" list.
4. We added a new task item named "Sample Todo".
5. We verified the creation of the task item.
6. We deleted the task item by swiping left and confirming the deletion.
7. We verified the deletion of the task item.

These steps correspond to all the main actions in the source test case, including creating a todo item, verifying its creation, and then deleting it. The migration has adapted to the specific UI and interaction patterns of the target application while maintaining the core functionality of the test.

Given that we have completed all the steps from the source test case and verified their execution, we can conclude that the test migration is complete. Therefore, I will respond with DONE:
