### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, null, (0, 365), none, "You don't have any todos"): The widget is not clicked and does not influence changes in GUI page elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, You don't have any todos, (0, 365), longClick, NULL): Triggering a long click doesn't navigate to a new page or reveal any new elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "You don't have any todos", (0, 365), swipe_to_right, "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to right. from:[0, 365] to:[320, 399] but no change on the page. No new dialog or page appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, No ID, (0, 365), swipe_to_left from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365], "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to left. from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365] does not lead to any navigation or appearance of new elements. It seems this action does not trigger any reactions on the page as the current page and the next page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), click, "Minimal"): Click to interact but no new page or widgets appear after the interaction, which indicates that this element may be non-interactive or may serve a cosmetic purpose.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), longClick, NULL): Long-click to open a context menu on the current page, where there aren't any new widgets or pages provided after the interaction. The next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON, suggesting that there may be no significant GUI differences in the transition.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe, "Minimal"): Swipe to right from:[16, 38] to:[88, 66] target element does not seem to cause major changes or navigation to a new page, as the GUI elements on the next page JSON data remain the same as the current page JSON. This likely signifies that the swipe action on this widget does not significantly alter the GUI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe_to_left, "Minimal"): Swipe to left. from:[88, 66] to:[16, 38] does not make any observable changes. The page components remain the same as before.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, More options, (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open additional options. The page after clicking this control shows a list with "Settings" and "About" options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, More options, (280, 28), longClickable, NULL): Long press on the 'More options' button. Long pressing on this control opens a settings page where user can change app settings like 'Night Mode'. The settings page contains choices like 'Night mode is off' that can be clicked or checked.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add new TODO item. The next page after clicking on this control is the TODO creation page, which has a text entry field with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText" for the ToDo title, a reminder setup with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/todoReminderAndDateContainerLayout", and a confirm button with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), long click, NULL): Long click to create a new todo. The page after the interaction is the create todo page, which includes a title input field with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText", a remind me option with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoHasDateSwitchCompat" and a save button with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided source test case semantics, current page's intentions, and executed action sequence, let's proceed with the test code migration. The first step in the source test case is to click the 'Skip' button to bypass the tutorial. However, there is no corresponding 'Skip' button in the target app's current page intentions. Therefore, this step can be skipped in the target app.

The second step in the source test case is to click on the 'New Task' button to create a new to-do task. The corresponding action in the target app's current page intentions is to click on the 'addToDoItemFAB' button to add a new TODO item. Therefore, the next action to be executed in the target app should be to click on the 'addToDoItemFAB' button.

Here is the next step of the migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add new TODO item.
~~~
The corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
d.click(248, 568)
```

````

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the executed actions and the source test case, you have successfully performed the first three steps of the source test case in the target application. The next step in the source test case is to confirm the creation of the new task. 

Looking at the intentions of the current page, the most similar action to the 'Okay' button confirmation in the source app is clicking the ImageButton with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton". This action creates a new 'ToDo' item named 'Sample Todo' on the main screen of the app, which matches the purpose of the 'Okay' button in the source app.

Therefore, the next step for the migration should be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton, (248, 192), click, NULL): Confirm the creation of the new task.
~~~
### Output:

Based on the information you've provided, here is the corresponding UIAutomator2 code:

···
d.click(248, 192)
···

In this case, the operation was to perform a click event on a button at a specific location (x=248, y=192). Thus we used `d.click(x, y)` function. The ID `com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton` was ignored as we preferred the coordinates for the operation.
````
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets

Based on the provided information, the steps that have been executed in the target application correspond to steps 2, 3, and 4 of the source test case. The next step in the source test case is to verify that the new task with the name 'Sample Todo' is present. 

From the current page's intentions, it appears that we can achieve this by checking the presence of 'Sample Todo' in the TextView with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview". 

The proposed action for the next step of the test case migration is as follows:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview, (77, 101), presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the new task with the name 'Sample Todo' is present.
~~~
Given the task, the converted code for the action using Uiautomator2 in Python will be:

···
assert d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview").get_text() == "Sample Todo"
···
