### Semantics of Source Test case
> This test case is testing the functionality of adding a new todo item, verifying its presence, deleting it, and then verifying its deletion in a todo list application.
> 
> The detailed process with serial numbers is as follows:
> 
> 1. ACTION (ImageButton, douzifly.list:id/fab_add, (), click, NULL) : Click on the add button to create a new todo item.
> 2. ACTION (EditText, douzifly.list:id/edit_text, (), input, "Sample Todo") : Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field and hide the keyboard.
> 3. ACTION (ImageButton, douzifly.list:id/fab_add, (), click, NULL) : Click on the add button to save the new todo item.
> 4. ASSERT (TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.
> 5. ACTION (TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (), swipe_right, NULL) : Swipe right on the todo item to reveal the delete option.
> 6. ACTION (TextView, douzifly.list:id/btn_delete, (), click, NULL) : Click on the delete button to remove the todo item.

### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), click, NULL): Click on the "Navigate up" button to open the navigation drawer. The new page introduces options represented by the 'Lists' tittle, and a clickable ListView under the id 'com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/nav_drawer_content', which includes the 'Shopping List' option.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, Navigate up, (0, 24), long click, NULL): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, no additional widgets appear. This implies that the action might be used to select the item for further actions or trigger a contextual menu.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Shopping List, (72, 38), click, NULL): The 'Shopping List' button was clicked, but no new page appears or new widgets show up. Instead, the current page is refreshed. The actions indicate that clicking the 'Shopping List' button refreshes the same page.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView, [0, 80], long_click, NULL): Long press to perform actions related to shopping list items. Long pressing on this control does not navigate to a new page, but likely invokes a contextual action mode or selection mode.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Shopping List, (72, 38), swipe_to_right, NULL): Swipe to right. from:[80, 38] to:[201, 66] to delete items from the shopping list. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but causes a change in the shopping list view with id "com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Shopping List, (72, 38), swipe_to_left, "NULL"): Swipe to left from:[201, 66] to:[80, 38] does not navigate to another page but the same page remains with the application widgets that include "Delete checked items" button with id "com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/action_delete_checked" and a set of additional options which is interactable indicated by id "android.widget.ImageView".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/action_delete_checked, (232, 28), click, NULL): Click to delete checked items from the shopping list. The page after clicking this control is a confirmation dialog that asks "Remove all checked items?". It provides two options - 'OK' which goes through with the deletion, and 'Cancel' which dismisses the operation.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/action_delete_checked, (232, 28), long click, NULL): Long click to delete checked items in the shopping list. After this action, no new page appears nor are there any new widgets.

The list of items appears in the shopping list, and no more items are added nor removed from it. There is also no change in the functionality of the "Delete checked items" action identified as com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/action_delete_checked, and the "More options" action. The layout does not change after the click action on the widget.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView, (0, 80), longClick, NULL): Long click to show more options. However, long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page or lead to any visual changes on the current page.
ACTION (android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/shoppingListView, (0, 80), swipe_to_right, NULL): Swipe to the right. from:[8, 80] to:[328, 640] to reveal more options.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given that the first operation has no executed actions, we'll start with the first step of the source test case and map it to the target application.

The first step in the source test case is to click on an add button to create a new todo item. Looking at the current page's intentions, we have an action to click on an ImageButton with id 'com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add' to add a new item to the shopping list. This action seems to correspond functionally to the first step of the source test case.

Therefore, the next action to migrate would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new item to the shopping list.
~~~
Certainly, here is how the given action can be transformed into UIAutomator2 code in Python using the provided device variable name 'd':

#### Input:

Uiautomator2 device variable name: d

ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/fab_add, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new item to the shopping list.

#### Output(The code should be wrapped using '···'):

```python
d.click(248, 568)
```

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given the information provided, it seems that the first step of the source test case has been successfully executed in the target application, which is to click on an "add" button to create a new todo item. The next step in the source test case is to input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field.

Looking at the intentions provided for the current page, the action that most closely resembles inputting text into a title field is:

ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description, (2, 502), click, "New Item"): Clicking on this control allows entry of a new item description.

Therefore, the next step should be to perform an input action on the 'new_item_description' field. Since the source test case specifies the text 'Sample Todo', we will use that as the value for the input action.

Here is the next step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description, (2, 502), input, "Sample Todo"): Input 'Sample Todo' as the new item description.
~~~
```
d.click(2, 502)
d(resourceId="com.woefe.shoppinglist:id/new_item_description").set_text("Sample Todo")
```
