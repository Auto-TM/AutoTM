### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click to activate the input app bar. After clicking, no new page appears and no new widgets are added. The current page remains active with editable text field for the new list name and an 'Add' button to create a new list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), long click, NULL): Long press to activate additional options for the 'Simply Do' title. No new page is navigated to, and no new widgets appear as a result of this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, "New List Name"): Click to edit the new list name on the existing list name field. No new elements or page appears after this interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), long_click, "New List Name"): Long click to edit the list name. No new page appears after the long click, but the list name field is highlighted for editing.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click to add a new list. The interaction with this control does not navigate to a new page, but presumably processes the input from the EditText field labeled "New List Name".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), longClick, "Add"): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes to the current page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the provided information, the first step of the migration of the test case from the source app to the target app would be to initiate the process of creating a new todo item.

The source test case starts with a click operation on an ImageButton with id 'fab_add' to initiate the creation of a new todo item. The equivalent interaction in the target app based on the current page's intentions would be to activate the AppBar input field by clicking on the TextView element with id 'title'. This should create a new list (or in context of the source app, a new todo item).

Given this, the first action to be executed in the target app for the test code migration will be as follows:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click to activate the input app bar for the creation of a new todo item.
~~~
Based on the given input, the ID "android:id/title" is not unique since it is associated with different coordinates. Therefore, we should use coordinates for the operation. Here is the generated UIAutomator2 code:

···
d.click(6, 25)
···

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click to activate the input app bar. After clicking, no new page appears and no new widgets are added. The current page remains active with editable text field for the new list name and an 'Add' button to create a new list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), long click, NULL): Long press to activate additional options for the 'Simply Do' title. No new page is navigated to, and no new widgets appear as a result of this action.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, "New List Name"): Click to edit the new list name on the existing list name field. No new elements or page appears after this interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), long_click, "New List Name"): Long click to edit the list name. No new page appears after the long click, but the list name field is highlighted for editing.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click to add a new list. The interaction with this control does not navigate to a new page, but presumably processes the input from the EditText field labeled "New List Name".
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), longClick, "Add"): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page or trigger any visible changes to the current page.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Considering the semantics of the source test case and the actions already taken in the target application, it seems that the first step of adding a new todo item has been successfully executed in the target app with a slightly different interaction (clicking on a TextView to activate the input bar rather than clicking an ImageButton). The next step in the source test case involves entering text for the new todo item.

Given the description of the current page's intentions and the successfully executed action sequence, the next action to migrate should be the input of the todo item's title. Since the source test case involves inputting text "Sample Todo" into an EditText field, the corresponding action in the target application would be to interact with the EditText field to input the new list name.

Therefore, the next step would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), input, "Sample Todo"): Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field and hide the keyboard.
~~~
Based on the input provided and the requirements, we need to generate UIAutomator2 code in Python to input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field and hide the keyboard.

Before generating the code, we need to determine whether the ID of the specified action is unique. From the "Page all action" section, we can see that the ID `kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText` is associated with coordinates (0, 49) for both click and long click actions, which indicates that the ID is unique.

Since the ID is unique, we can use it in the code. However, the optimal choice is to operate based on coordinates. Since the coordinates are precise, we will use them to perform the action.

Here is the UIAutomator2 code in Python to perform the action:

```
d.click(0, 49)  # Click on the EditText field by coordinates to focus it
d.send_keys("Sample Todo")  # Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the EditText field
d.press('enter')  # Press enter to hide the keyboard
```

This code will focus on the EditText field, input the text 'Sample Todo', and then press enter to hide the keyboard.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click to interact with the application. No new widgets introduced or new pages navigated after this action based on the comparison of current page JSON and next page JSON. The action does not appear to have any impact on the user interface.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), long click, "Simply Do"): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a new todo list item is added on the current page. This list item contains two elements, a text element titled 'Sample Todo' and a secondary text element with '(0/0)' as its content.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, NULL): Click to focus on the input field for adding a new list. After clicking, no new page is opened; the input remains on the same page, awaiting list name entry.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), long_click, NULL): Long clicking on this control allows for additional input options or editing the content of the list name field. This action does not navigate to a new page, nor does it appear to modify the existing interface as the next page JSON data is the same as the current page JSON data.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click to add a new list. After clicking this button, a new todo list item is added to the current page's list view, as indicated by new entry in the Next Page JSON data.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), long click, NULL): Long click to bring up list management options. Interaction with this control does not navigate to a new page, but possibly triggers list management actions or a context menu.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), click, NULL): Click to select an item from the list. After the click, no new page appears, but the list is potentially refreshed or an item is selected for further interaction.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), longClick, NULL): Long press to bring up list options. The page after long pressing this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog comes up with the options to 'Edit' or 'Delete' the list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), click, "Sample Todo"): Clicking on this widget navigates to the specific 'Sample Todo' list page where tasks can be added or managed. The next page includes an option to add new items to the 'Sample Todo' list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10,109), long_click, NULL): Long click to show list options. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog/popupMenu which includes edit and delete options appears. The new dialog has "Edit" and "Delete" components.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), click, "(0/0)"): Click to view details. Clicking on this control navigates to a new page where a new item can be added to the 'Sample Todo' list. This page includes an EditText field for entering the new item name and an 'Add' button for adding the item.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), longClick, NULL): The action reveals options for the current to-do list. Long clicking on this control opens a list options dialog that includes editing and deleting the list.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the current status of the executed actions, it seems that the next step in the source test case semantics is to delete the todo item as per steps 5 and 6. From the current page's intentions, the closest match to this step is to long click on the todo item to bring up the List Options menu, which includes the option to delete the list.

Therefore, the next step in test case migration would be:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), longClick, "Sample Todo"): Open the "List Options" dialog with options to "Edit" and "Delete".
~~~
### Output:
Based on the provided information, the output UIAutomator2 code in Python should be as follows:

···
d.long_click(10, 109, 1)
···

In this case, the coordinates are precise and the ID is not unique, so the coordinates are used to perform a long click on the UI element.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (25, 247), click, "NULL"): Click to open the list options dialog. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but displays a pop-up menu/dialog which includes Edit and Delete options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (25, 247), long click, "List Options"): Long click to open the list options dialog. The list options dialog presents options to either edit or delete a list. Performing a long click on this control does not navigate to a new page, but instead, a dialog with "Edit" and "Delete" options appears.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, android:id/select_dialog_listview, (15, 293), click, NULL): Click to show list options. After clicking on this control, the same "List Options" page remains open, providing options for "Edit" and "Delete".

Based on the provided information, the source test case has completed the following steps in the target application:

1. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click to activate the input app bar for the creation of a new todo item.
2. ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), input, "Sample Todo"): Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field and hide the keyboard.
3. ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click on the add button to save the new todo item.
4. ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.
5. ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), longClick, "Sample Todo"): Open the "List Options" dialog with options to "Edit" and "Delete".

The next steps in the source test case are to delete a todo item and verify its deletion:

5. ACTION (TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (), swipe_right, NULL) : Swipe right on the todo item to reveal the delete option. (This step corresponds to revealing the delete option in the source app, which has been replaced by a long click in the target app to open the "List Options" dialog.)
6. ACTION (TextView, douzifly.list:id/btn_delete, (), click, NULL) : Click on the delete button to remove the todo item.

Given that the "List Options" dialog in the target application has been opened and includes a delete option, we would proceed with the deletion:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (25, 375), click, "Delete"): Click to show the deletion confirmation dialog.
~~~

This action will prompt the user for confirmation to delete the item, which aligns with the next logical step in our source test case: removing the todo item.
Based on the provided actions, the UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/alertTitle, (25, 246), long click, "Delete?"): Long click to trigger contextual options related to the list item. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog/popupMenu which includes "Yes" and "No" options appears, prompting the user to confirm or cancel the deletion of the list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (29, 294), click, "Are you sure you want to delete this list?"): Click to confirm the deletion action. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a confirmation dialog appears, which includes Yes and No options.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (29, 294), longClick, "Are you sure you want to delete this list?"): Holding this message does not navigate to a new page, but it might trigger another UI event or function in the application. The change between the current page and next page JSON is not apparent in the given data.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (17, 374), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of the list. Post-click, the app navigates to the main page where all existing to-do lists are shown.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (17, 374), longClick, "Yes"): Upon long-clicking the button, the user is navigated from the delete confirmation dialog to the main screen where a new list can be created. The main screen presents a text field for entering the list name, an "Add" button for submitting the list, and a list view to display existing lists.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (161, 374), click, "No"): Click to cancel the delete operation. The page after clicking this button returns to the main to-do list, showing the list items and their states.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button2, (161, 374), long_click, "No"): The action is to long click on "No" button at coordinates (161, 374) to dismiss the delete confirmation dialog. The next page is the home screen with the list of todos, indicating the delete operation was cancelled.

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, android:id/message, (29, 294), wait_until_text_presence, "Are you sure you want to delete this list?"): Verify that the deletion confirmation dialog appears.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, android:id/button1, (17, 374), click, "Yes"): Click to confirm deletion of the list. 
~~~
Based on the given actions, the corresponding UIAutomator2 code in Python would be:

```python
# Assertion
assert d(resourceId="android:id/message").wait.exists(timeout=3000)
# Click action
d.click(17, 374)
```

Please note that the `wait_until_text_presence` action was translated to `d(resourceId="android:id/message").wait.exists(timeout=3000)`. This is because UIAutomator2 does not have a specific `wait_until_text_presence` function, but it does have a `wait.exists()` function which waits until the UI element with the specified resourceId appears. The timeout parameter is set to 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) as a standard wait time. If the element does not appear within this time, the assertion will fail. 

The click action is straightforward, we use the `d.click(x, y)` function with the given coordinates.

Given the executed action sequence and the original test case semantics, it can be observed that multiple steps of the source test case have been successfully migrated to the target application, which includes adding a new to-do item, verifying its presence, and deleting the item. 

The next step in the source test case is to verify that the deleted item is no longer visible within 10 seconds. In order to achieve this, we can assert the invisibility of the text 'Sample Todo' in the target application. 

Here is the next step for the migration:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is not visible within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on the given input, the test semantic description needs to be converted into UIAutomator2 code in Python. Since the input specifies an assertion, the corresponding code will check whether the text 'Sample Todo' is not visible within a certain time frame. 

Here is the Python code using UIAutomator2 for the given action:

```python
import uiautomator2 as u2
import time

# Connect to the device
d = u2.connect('ip')

# Start of the generated code
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    if not d(text="Sample Todo").exists:
        break
    time.sleep(1)
else:
    raise AssertionError("Text 'Sample Todo' is still visible after 10 seconds")
# End of the generated code
```

The above code snippet uses a while loop to check for the visibility of the text 'Sample Todo' for up to 10 seconds. If the text becomes invisible within that time frame, the loop breaks, and the assertion passes. If the text is still visible after 10 seconds, the code raises an AssertionError.

#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), click, "Simply Do"): Click on "Simply Do" title. This action does not navigate to a new page, but refreshes the current page emphasizing on the same title "Simply Do". No new widgets appear after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (6, 25), longClicked, "Simply Do"): Long clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the same page reloads again, possibly with app data updated in the background.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), click, NULL): Click to focus on the input field for entering a new list name. No new page appears, and no immediate visual feedback occurs indicating a successful action, as the Next Page JSON is identical to the Current Page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListEditText, (0, 49), longClick, "New List Name"): The long click on this control does not navigate to a new page, but it likely triggers a context menu or modifies the behavior of subsequent interactions with the widget.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), click, "Add"): Click on this control to add a new list. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but allows you to input the name of the new list in the 'New List Name' field.
ACTION (android.widget.Button, kdk.android.simplydo:id/AddListButton, (273, 49), long_click, "Add"): Long click to initiate list addition. After the action, no new page appears but the option to add a new list is enabled with an EditText for 'New List Name' available.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), click, NULL): Clicking this control navigates to the same page, but an option to delete the selected list appears. The new dialog has two options: 'Yes' or 'No' to confirm the deletion.
ACTION (android.widget.ListView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/ListsListView, (0, 99), longClick, NULL): LongClick to view list options. The new dialog appears with options 'Edit' and 'Delete'.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), click, "Sample Todo"): The click navigates to the/todo list 'Sample Todo'. The next page allows the user to add items to this list with 'New Item Name' textbox field and 'Add' button.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text1, (10, 109), longClick, "Sample Todo"): Long clicking on this widget opens the "List Options" dialog with options to "Edit" and "Delete".
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, kdk.android.simplydo:id/text2, (278, 113), click, "(0/0)"): Click to open 'Sample Todo' list. The page after clicking this control is the 'Sample Todo' list page, which has a 'New Item Name' input field and an 'Add' button.
