### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, "", (0, 24), click, NULL): Click to open the navigation menu. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a menu appears. The new menu has options such as "All tasks" with id "org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/design_menu_item_text", and "Settings" with id "org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/design_menu_item_text".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, NULL, (0, 24), long click, NULL): Invokes the main navigation menu. A long click on this button does not navigate to a new page, but rather expands the additional menu options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/fab_new_task, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new task. No new page is loaded, implying the same page is potentially updated to allow the user to input details for a new task.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/ac_add, (232, 28), long click, NULL): Long click to display list options. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog/popup which includes edit and delete item options appears.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/ac_add, (232, 28), click, NULL): Click to add a new To-Do list. Clicking this control navigates to a page where a new To-Do list can be created, with an input field for the list name (EditText with id "org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/et_todo_list_name") and options to cancel ("org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/bt_newtodolist_cancel") or confirm ("org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/bt_newtodolist_ok") the creation.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open the options menu. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a list view with various sorting and filter options appears, including "Group by priority" and "Sort by deadline" both with associated checkboxes.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (280, 28), long_click, NULL): Long-click to open more options. No new page is navigated, but a popupMenu appears with additional settings or functionalities related to the To-Do list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_empty_view_no_tasks, (0, 80), click, "No tasks available"): Click to refresh or indicate no tasks available. No navigation occurs; the state of the page remains with "No tasks available" message displayed.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_empty_view_no_tasks, (0, 80), long_click, "No tasks available"): Long click to open context menu for tasks management. No difference detected between Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON after the interaction, indicating the long click action does not navigate to a new page or cause the appearance of new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/initial_alert, (162, 96), click, "CLICK + FOR NEW LIST"): Clicking this control does not navigate to a new page, but suggests user action to create a new list.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/initial_alert, (162, 96), long_click, "CLICK + FOR NEW LIST"): Long click to prompt adding a new list. Since interaction does not result in a new page and there is no difference between Current Page JSON and Next Page JSON, it indicates that the long click potentially triggers an in-page event such as a tooltip or a popup without navigating away or altering the currently visible elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/second_alert, (107, 587), click, "ADD NEW TASK >"): Clicking on this button does not lead to a new page. The widgets remain the same as prior to the click. The user intent is to add a new task but it requires further interaction or fulfillment of a certain condition.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/second_alert, (107, 587), longClick, "ADD NEW TASK >"): Long Clicking on the "ADD NEW TASK >" widget doesn't navigate to a new page and no new widgets appear.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given that the first operation has no executed actions, we need to start from the beginning of the source test case and find the corresponding action in the target application based on the current page's intentions.

The first step in the source test case is to click on the add button to create a new todo item.

Looking at the current page's intentions, the action that corresponds to this functionality is:
`ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/fab_new_task, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new task.`

This action seems to match the intent of the first step in the source test case, as both involve initiating the creation of a new task item. Therefore, the first action to perform in the target app would be to click the 'add new task' button.

Here is the first migrated action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/fab_new_task, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add a new task.
~~~
Certainly, here's the UIAutomator2 code converted from the Action input provided:

···
d.click(248, 568)
···

In this case, the action is to click on the FloatingActionButton (identified by the 'fab_new_task' resource id or the specified coordinates) to add a new task. The operation uses the coordinates (248, 568) for the click.

Based on the source test case semantics and the executed action sequence, we are currently at the step of adding a new todo item in the target application. The next step in the source test case is to input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field. 

From the list of intentions of the current page in the target application, the equivalent action for the next step can be found. The action is to click on the EditText field with id 'org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/et_new_task_name' to enter a task name.

Here is the next step of the test migration:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/et_new_task_name, (26, 205), click, NULL): Click to enter a task name.
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/et_new_task_name, (26, 205), input, "Sample Todo"): Input the text 'Sample Todo' into the title field.
~~~
Sure, based on your input parameters I am able to generate the resulting UIAutomator2 python code.

The UIAutomator2 Python script code, according to your parameters, should look like this(The code should be wrapped using '···'):

···
d.click(26, 205)
d(resourceId="org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/et_new_task_name").set_text("Sample Todo")

Based on the provided information, the next step in the source test case is to delete the 'Sample Todo' item. In the source app, this is done by swiping right on the todo item to reveal the delete option. However, in the target app, long clicking on the task name brings up a dialog/popupMenu which includes edit and delete item options.

So, the next step in the target app would be to long click on the 'Sample Todo' task to bring up the options menu and then select the delete option. The action sequence for this step would be as follows:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, org.secuso.privacyfriendlytodolist:id/tv_exlv_task_name, (55, 90), long click, "Sample Todo"): Long click to bring up the options menu.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, android:id/title, (), click, "Delete To-Do Task"): Click on the 'Delete To-Do Task' option to delete the task.
~~~
Based on the requirements and actions described, here's how you would convert the given action semantic descriptions into Python UIAutomator2 code:

```python
# Action: Long click on the 'Sample Todo' task item.
d.long_click(55, 90, 1)

# Action: Click on the 'Delete To-Do Task' option to delete the task.
d(text="Delete To-Do Task").click()
