### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, null, (0, 365), none, "You don't have any todos"): The widget is not clicked and does not influence changes in GUI page elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, You don't have any todos, (0, 365), longClick, NULL): Triggering a long click doesn't navigate to a new page or reveal any new elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "You don't have any todos", (0, 365), swipe_to_right, "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to right. from:[0, 365] to:[320, 399] but no change on the page. No new dialog or page appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, No ID, (0, 365), swipe_to_left from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365], "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to left. from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365] does not lead to any navigation or appearance of new elements. It seems this action does not trigger any reactions on the page as the current page and the next page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), click, "Minimal"): Click to interact but no new page or widgets appear after the interaction, which indicates that this element may be non-interactive or may serve a cosmetic purpose.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), longClick, NULL): Long-click to open a context menu on the current page, where there aren't any new widgets or pages provided after the interaction. The next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON, suggesting that there may be no significant GUI differences in the transition.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe, "Minimal"): Swipe to right from:[16, 38] to:[88, 66] target element does not seem to cause major changes or navigation to a new page, as the GUI elements on the next page JSON data remain the same as the current page JSON. This likely signifies that the swipe action on this widget does not significantly alter the GUI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe_to_left, "Minimal"): Swipe to left. from:[88, 66] to:[16, 38] does not make any observable changes. The page components remain the same as before.

Based on the provided information, the next step would be to verify if the 'Sample Todo' item has been added successfully. This can be done by asserting the presence of the text 'Sample Todo' in the current page's text views. The corresponding action from the source test case is:

4. ASSERT (TextView, douzifly.list:id/txt_thing, (), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo") : Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.

The corresponding action in the target application, based on the current page's intentions, could be:

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview, (77, 101), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.

Here is the output:

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview, (77, 101), wait_until_text_presence, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is present within 10 seconds.
~~~
Based on your input, here is the converted Uiautomator2 code:

```python
import time
start = time.time()
while time.time() - start < 10:
    if d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview").get_text() == "Sample Todo":
        break
    time.sleep(1)
assert d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview").get_text() == "Sample Todo"

start = time.time()
while time.time() - start < 10:
    if d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview").get_text() == "Sample Todo":
        break
    time.sleep(1)
assert d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview").get_text() == "Sample Todo"
```

In this code, we have a 10-second timer. After each timer, an assert operation is performed to confirm if the text 'Sample Todo' is present as a text in the specified TextView element.

Based on the source test case and the executed action sequence, the next step is to delete the 'Sample Todo' item. According to the current page's intentions, this can be achieved by swiping to the right on the 'Sample Todo' item. Thus, the next action to perform is:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview, (77, 101), swipe to right. from:[77, 101] to:[320, 123], "Sample Todo"): Swipe to right. from:[77, 101] to:[320, 123] to delete the Todo item.
~~~
Based on the given parameters and actions, the Uiautomator2 code in Python would look like this:

···
d.swipe(77, 101, 320, 123)
···
Here, the code is instructing the UIAutomator2 to swipe on the screen from the coordinates (77,101) to (320,123) in order to delete a Todo item.

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, null, (0, 365), none, "You don't have any todos"): The widget is not clicked and does not influence changes in GUI page elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, You don't have any todos, (0, 365), longClick, NULL): Triggering a long click doesn't navigate to a new page or reveal any new elements.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, "You don't have any todos", (0, 365), swipe_to_right, "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to right. from:[0, 365] to:[320, 399] but no change on the page. No new dialog or page appears after this action.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, No ID, (0, 365), swipe_to_left from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365], "You don't have any todos"): Swipe to left. from:[320, 399] to:[0, 365] does not lead to any navigation or appearance of new elements. It seems this action does not trigger any reactions on the page as the current page and the next page JSON are identical.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), click, "Minimal"): Click to interact but no new page or widgets appear after the interaction, which indicates that this element may be non-interactive or may serve a cosmetic purpose.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), longClick, NULL): Long-click to open a context menu on the current page, where there aren't any new widgets or pages provided after the interaction. The next page JSON is identical to the current page JSON, suggesting that there may be no significant GUI differences in the transition.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe, "Minimal"): Swipe to right from:[16, 38] to:[88, 66] target element does not seem to cause major changes or navigation to a new page, as the GUI elements on the next page JSON data remain the same as the current page JSON. This likely signifies that the swipe action on this widget does not significantly alter the GUI.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Minimal, (16, 38), swipe_to_left, "Minimal"): Swipe to left. from:[88, 66] to:[16, 38] does not make any observable changes. The page components remain the same as before.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, More options, (280, 28), click, NULL): Click to open additional options. The page after clicking this control shows a list with "Settings" and "About" options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, More options, (280, 28), longClickable, NULL): Long press on the 'More options' button. Long pressing on this control opens a settings page where user can change app settings like 'Night Mode'. The settings page contains choices like 'Night mode is off' that can be clicked or checked.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), click, NULL): Click to add new TODO item. The next page after clicking on this control is the TODO creation page, which has a text entry field with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText" for the ToDo title, a reminder setup with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/todoReminderAndDateContainerLayout", and a confirm button with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton".
ACTION (android.widget.ImageButton, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/addToDoItemFAB, (248, 568), long click, NULL): Long click to create a new todo. The page after the interaction is the create todo page, which includes a title input field with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/userToDoEditText", a remind me option with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoHasDateSwitchCompat" and a save button with id "com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/makeToDoFloatingActionButton".

ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview, (77, 101), wait_until_text_invisible, "Sample Todo"): Verify that the text 'Sample Todo' is not visible within 10 seconds.
~~~
### Output:

Based on the user actions provided, here's the UIAutomator2 code in Python: 

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 10:
    element = d(resourceId="com.rubenroy.minimaltodo:id/toDoListItemTextview").get_text()
    if element != "Sample Todo":
        break
    time.sleep(1)

assert element != "Sample Todo", "Text 'Sample Todo' is still visible after 10 seconds."
```

In this code, we're setting a loop to continuously check for the visibility of the text "Sample Todo" within 10 seconds. If the text becomes invisible within this time, we break out of the loop. If the text is still visible after 10 seconds, the assertion fails, and the test case will fail because the text is still visible.
