### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````

ACTION (android.widget.ScrollView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_product_grid, (0, 64), scroll, NULL): Clicking on the grid leads to a scroll action. This action does not navigate to a new page but adjusts the position and size of image elements within the grid. New positions of existing ImageView elements observed after action.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 64), click, NULL): Click to explore items. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the product images resize and the layout adjusts. New product images appear with varying dimensions reflecting updated selections or promotions.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 64), click, NULL): Clicking the image does not navigate to a new page but may potentially trigger a specific action or refresh elements within the page as the widget attributes in the next page JSON align closely with those in the current page JSON, with the main difference being dimensions and placement of child elements in the grid layout.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 347), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the size and arrangement of images in the product grid were adjusted, signifying a potential refresh or update of the content.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 347), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but possibly refreshes the current product display grid. The sizes and positions of product images are adjusted, indicating the grid's content has been updated or shuffled.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 697), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but rearranges the product display grid with new dimensions for product images. The new layout has been adjusted for a refreshed product presentation.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 697), click, NULL): Clicking the image does not change the page or modify any visible content elements. The action does not navigate to a new page nor does it alter the state of other elements in a visible way.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 1047), click, NULL): Click to explore products. Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the product display layout changes, displaying a new arrangement of products with clickable and longClickable properties.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 1047), click, NULL): Click to interact with the product grid. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but product items in the grid are possibly re-arranged or updated. The product images are clickable and might show more details or provide shopping options.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 1397), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but adjusts the display of items within the product grid. The heights of items in the product grid are changed to accommodate more detailed views.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 1397), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but changes the layout of products in the scrollable area. The images of products are resized and rearranged indicating a refresh or update in the product display.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_tagline_text, (170, 641), click, NULL): Click on the tagline text does not navigate to a new page or change the current view but might trigger further actions or details about smarter shopping.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button, (170, 801), click, "Create Account"): Clicking leads to the account creation screen where the user can enter their personal details such as 'First Name', 'Last Name', 'Email', 'Confirm Email', and 'Password'. This page allows users to either create an account manually or sign in using Facebook or Google, additionally displaying the 'Terms of Service and Privacy Policy'.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_sign_in_button, (170, 958), click, "Sign In"): Click to navigate to sign in page. No visible changes on the page, indicating either a state where login details are to be entered or a subsequent action is required.

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Based on the source test case semantics and the current page's intentions, the first step in the source test case is to verify the presence of the 'Me' button within 10 seconds. However, there's no direct match for a 'Me' button or similar functionality in the current page's intentions. The closest related action is the navigation to a user account creation or sign-in page, which might indirectly involve user profile management.

Given that the first step in the source test case involves navigating to the profile section, and the current page's intentions include actions for account creation and sign-in, we can consider matching this step to navigating to the account creation screen.

Here is the proposed migration step:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button, (170, 801), click, "Create Account"): Clicking leads to the account creation screen where the user can enter their personal details such as 'First Name', 'Last Name', 'Email', 'Confirm Email', and 'Password'. This page allows users to either create an account manually or sign in using Facebook or Google, additionally displaying the 'Terms of Service and Privacy Policy'.
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button, (170, 801), wait_until_element_presence, "id:com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button"): Verify that the 'Create Account' button is present within 10 seconds.
~~~

This step combines the action of clicking on the 'Create Account' button with the assertion to check its presence, simulating the navigation and verification steps in the source test case.
···
d.click(170, 801)
assert d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button").exists(timeout=10)
