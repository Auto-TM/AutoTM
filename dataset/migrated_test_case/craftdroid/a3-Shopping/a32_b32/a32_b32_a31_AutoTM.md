### Process
#### Contextual Semantics of Widgets
````

ACTION (android.widget.ScrollView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_product_grid, (0, 64), scroll, NULL): Click to navigate through products. The page after interaction remains with layout changes in the product grid size, displaying different products in a streamlined manner, ensuring optimal browsing experience.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 64), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but the image views are refreshed, resizing some images in the product grid.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 64), click, NULL): Clicking on this widget does not navigate to a new page, but alters the layout within the current page. Notably, the product images in the grid layout have been resized, indicating a dynamic adjustment to the display or a refresh of content.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_product_grid, (20, 345), click, NULL): Click to view details or interact with the item. Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but some internal changes in the layout might occur such as resizing of image grids.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 345), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but may trigger a subtle change or action within the same layout, as no ID or text description is provided for this widget and no new active elements appear in the next page JSON compared to the current page JSON.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 695), click, NULL): Clicking on the ImageView does not navigate to a new page but potentially could trigger visibility changes or other interactions within the same page.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 695), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but reorganizes items within the same page, particularly adjusting the layout and size of product images.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_product_grid, (20, 1045), click, NULL): Clicking this image does not navigate to a new page, but remains on the current product grid. Swiping this control up and down allows for viewing of different products without changing the page layout.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_product_grid, (370, 1045), click, NULL): No significant changes appear on the page regarding content or layout. The existing elements maintain their locations and properties, suggesting that the click action does not trigger any navigation or open any new widgets.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (20, 1395), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but adjusts the content layout. The adjustment is seen in the resizing or repositioning of images within the same scrollable product grid. Notably, the last image in the list changes its dimensions from a height of 205 to 265, suggesting content refresh or update without leaving the current page context.
ACTION (android.widget.ImageView, , (370, 1395), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but updates the product grid layout. The new layout has resized images but retains similar functionalities, indicating a dynamic response to the interaction without significant navigation changes.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_tagline_text, (170, 641), click, NULL): Clicking on this control does not navigate to a new page, but maintains presence on the current login introduction page, potentially reaffirming the 'Smarter Shopping' message.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_create_account_button, (170, 801), click, "Create Account"): Click to navigate to account creation page. This page includes fields for "First Name", "Last Name", "Email", "Confirm Email", and "Password", along with an option to sign in with Facebook or Google.
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_sign_in_button, (170, 958), click, "Sign In"): Click to navigate to the sign-in page. This action does not lead to a new page but displays a similar layout with updated product images and dimensions in the 'login_fragment_product_grid'.
ACTION (android.widget.ScrollView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_product_grid, (0, 64), click, NULL): Swiping on this control does not navigate to a new page, but a dialog/popupMenu which includes edit and delete item appears. the new dialog has a edit button with id "autotm.test:id/edit_button" and a delete item component with id "autotm.test:id/delete_item".

#### Selected Event(s) and Script
````
Given the source test case's intention to test login functionality, and the current page's intention description, the appropriate step to begin migration is to ensure the presence of the login elements such as the email and password fields. Since the executed action sequence is empty, we start from the first step in the source test case.

Based on the source test case, the first action is to assert the presence of the password field. Let's find a corresponding action in the current page's intentions that would allow us to ensure the presence or readiness of the login elements.

Looking at the current page's intentions, there is an action that navigates to the sign-in page:
```
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_sign_in_button, (170, 958), click, "Sign In"): Click to navigate to the sign-in page. This action does not lead to a new page but displays a similar layout with updated product images and dimensions in the 'login_fragment_product_grid'.
```

Since the action sequence is empty, this would be a logical starting point to ensure we are on the login page, and it matches the purpose of navigating to the sign-in page where the email and password fields are expected to be present.

Here is the suggested next action:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/login_fragment_sign_in_button, (170, 958), click, NULL): Click to navigate to the sign-in page.
~~~
```
d.click(170, 958)
d.click(170, 958)
```

ACTION (android.widget.TextView, Sign In, (170, 914), click, "Sign In"): Clicks the 'Sign In' button to log in and there is no navigation to a new page if the entered credentials are incorrect, the results in a dialog which specifies that entered credentials are invalid.
