#### Selected Event(s) and Script

~~~
ASSERT (android.widget.TextView, com.contextlogic.wish:id/sign_in_fragment_sign_in_text, (32, 452), wait_until_element_presence, "id:com.contextlogic.wish:id/sign_in_fragment_sign_in_text"): Verify that the 'Sign In' button is present within 15 seconds.
~~~
Certainly! Based on the provided details in the 'Actions', it's an ASSERT operation. Since there's no direct function in UIAutomator2 to wait for an element's presence for a specific duration like 15 seconds, we'll assume device.wait is set appropriately to handle such conditions. We can convert the given test scenario into the appropriate UIAutomator2 code segment. Given the format and information provided, the output would be as follows:

···
assert (d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/sign_in_fragment_sign_in_text").exists(timeout=15000))
···

In this code:
- We use the `exists()` method from uiautomator2, with a specified timeout argument to handle the waiting logic.
- The timeout is specified in milliseconds, thus `15000` for 15 seconds.
- The `resourceId` used is presumed to be unique as per the assumption for test input processing, matching the given ID.

Based on the provided information, the next step in the source test case after inputting the password is to input the email address. The executed action sequence indicates that the last successful action was inputting the password. Therefore, we should now find the corresponding action for inputting the email in the target application.

Looking at the current page's intent description, the action that corresponds to inputting the email address is:

```
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.contextlogic.wish:id/emailText, (32, 550), click, NULL): Opens the keyboard to input the email address for signing in.
```

The next action to migrate from the source test case is to input the email address. Therefore, the next step is to perform an input action on the email field with the designated email address from the source test case.

Here is the required output:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.EditText, com.contextlogic.wish:id/emailText, (32, 550), input, "autotm12345@gmail.com"): Input the email 'autotm12345@gmail.com' into the email field and hide the keyboard.

Based on the source test case semantics and the executed action sequence, it appears that the test migration has successfully completed the following steps of the source test case:

1. Asserting the presence of the 'Sign In' button.
2. Clicking on the 'Sign In' button to initiate the login process.
3. Asserting the presence of the password field.
4. Inputting the password into the password field.
5. Clicking on the email field to input the email address.
6. Inputting the email into the email field.

The next step in the source test case is:

6. ACTION (TextView, com.contextlogic.geek:id/sign_in_fragment_sign_in_button, (), click, NULL) : Click on the 'Sign In' button to submit the login credentials.

Considering the current page's intentions, the corresponding action to submit the login credentials on the target app would be:

ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.contextlogic.wish:id/signInButton, (32, 803), click, NULL): Clicking on this control navigates to the home page.

Since the previous steps have been successfully executed and the next logical step is to submit the credentials, we will proceed with the 'Sign In' action on the target app.

Here is the next action to be executed:

~~~
ACTION (android.widget.Button, com.contextlogic.wish:id/signInButton, (32, 803), click, NULL): Submit the login credentials and navigate to the home page.

Based on your input, the UIAutomator2 code in Python for your test case is as follows:

```python
import time
for _ in range(10):
    try:
        assert (d(resourceId="com.contextlogic.wish:id/menu_profile_name").get_text() == "Sealbot Labfellow")

    except AssertionError:
        time.sleep(1)
else:
    raise AssertionError("User name 'Sealbot Labfellow' is not present within 10 seconds in the profile section of the menu.")
```
In this code, we loop 10 times, trying to find the text 'Sealbot Labfellow' each time. If we still can't find it after 10 attempts, we raise an `AssertionError`.
